Ticketing for FYP

This project is a ticketing system that controls tickets (booking of an issue or complaint) from students and staff alike in school. It controls and allows fast resolution of issues. It is an online platform that is majorly made for revalidation but other features such as timetable clashes, issues with portal and course registration, general complaints for easy follow up. Once a user issues a ticket, it is on display and the necessary department handles it and comments feedback. Each ticket is given an ID for easy recognition and search.
There will be different departments to handle cases, general (for every department) and operations (exam office, staff- course advisor, lecturers, maintainance for hostel services, if students have issues with door etc, cafeteria issues, PPD issues, DSA)
A ticket is first issued as an open case, once a ticket has been attended to, it is marked as resolved. And feedback is sent to the mail of complainant. Up on creation, the complainant gets a mail response that ticket has been created.

Implementation:
#username will be the school email
#password
A mail will be sent to the person's mail for validation.
They can have username for fast identification in their profile and change password feature

Languages:
Mysql for database to keep tickets and history if queried for.
PHP and Javascript and HTML for the view for coding.
